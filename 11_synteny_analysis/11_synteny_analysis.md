### Synteny analysis of _Coregonus albula_ assembly

- the 40 chromosomes from our assembly were used for this analysis
- the following _Coregnus_ ssp. genome assemblies were downloaded from ENA:

  - [_Coregonus_ sp. 'balchen', GCA_902810595.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_902810595.1/)
  - [_Coregonus clupeaformis_, GCF_020615455.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_020615455.1/)
  - [_Coregonus artedi_, GCA_039881085](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_039881085.1/)

- 40 chromosomes were extracted from reference assemblies 'balchen' and _C. clupeaformis_ and the chromosomes names were shortened to 1-40
- 38 chromosomes were extracted from reference assembly _C. aretedi_ and the chromosomes names were shortened to LG01-LG38
